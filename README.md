This is an app through which you can click pictures from the app and directly upload them to your selected folder in the drive. This app will help people making datasets not have the hassle of creating folders 
clicking pictures, sorting them,
migrating them to cloud, and storing them.


P.S. I was too lazy to click pictures and send them to my laptop all the time while also creating new train test folders for my dataset. So, this app does it in seconds for thousands of folder if you have different categories of data.
It is linked to my drive now. One will have to connect with their google drive to run this. You can get the credentials through google cloud.
The credentials in github are fake, so definitely change it.
