This is an app through which you can click pictures from app and directly upload to your selected folder. This app will help people making datasets not have the hassle of creatingg folders 
clicking picture, sorting them,
migrating them to cloud, and storing them.


P.s. I was too lazy to click pictures and send to my laptop all the time for my dataset creation creating new train test folders. So, this app does it in seconds.
It is linked to my drive now. One will have to connect with their google drive to run this. You can get the credentials through google cloud.
